Drift go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...
## Installation
### Source Code

*It is easier to download this from my website https://rishaankotian.wixsite.com/home/driftparty, there you just have to click download to download the source code, here the steps are a bit confusing*

- Download all of the 7zip files into a folder on your computer
- (Have 7zip downloaded on your device)
- select all of the 7zip files that you downloaded, right click them (If you are on windows 11, right click and click show more options) and hover over 7zip
- click extract and continue, (the file is over 1 gb so it might take a while to extract)
- The source code for my game should be downloaded
- I used Unity Hub production And Unity Editor 2021.1.28f1
